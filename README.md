# accountability-solution
This repository includes a Docker-based accountability solution based on Sysdig, Librdkafka producer, Kafka and MongoDB. This approach aims to identify the causes that have triggered a set of specific events, thanks to the use of the syscalls run by the monitored system. Features such as being completely decoupled from the monitored system, real-time analysis and optimized querying make this solution an optimal choice when it comes to understanding the root causes of a system's behaviour. Different assessment scenarios have been developed to define the best strategy to reduce the impact of the audit process and logging tasks.
